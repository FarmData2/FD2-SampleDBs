# Sample Data for transplanting.
# 
# The data in this file creates tray seedings that are then transplanted.
# Thus, these crops will appear in the sample database in a variety 
# of ways.
#  - Some will be fully transplanted (i.e. all trays)
#  - Some will be partially transplanted (i.e. some trays remain in greenhouse)
#  - Some will used multiple transplant operations to move all trays.
#
# Format:
#
# Each pair of lines represents a tray seeding followed by a transplanting and
# contains the following comma delimited information:
#   ts_date,ts_cropName,ts_locationName,ts_trays,ts_traySize,ts_seedsPerCell,ts_comment
#   tx_date,tx_trays,tx_bed_feet,tx_bed_width,tx_rows_per_bed,tx_location_count,tx_locations...,tx_locations...,tx_comment
#
# Anything following a # on a line is a considered a comment.
# Thus, names and descriptions cannot contain #
# Blank Lines are ignored.

THIS FILE IS NOT YET COMPLETE... 
TRANSPLANTING INFORMATION STILL NEEDS TO BE ADDED...
SOME SHOULD BE A COMPLETE TRANSPLANT, 
SOME SHOULD HAVE MULTIPLE TRANSPLANT OPERATIONS
SOME SHOULD BE A PARTIAL TRANSPLANT, LEAVING SOME TRAYS
