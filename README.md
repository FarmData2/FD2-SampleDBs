# FD2-SampleDBs

Code and tools for building the sample databases used for FarmData2 development.

All of the following documentation assumes that operations are performed within the FarmData2 Development Environment.

## Building the Databases

The following scripts contained in the `bin` directory are used to build the sample databases:

- `buildBaseDB.bash`: Builds an empty farmOS database.  This is used as a base for building other sample databases.

## Manually Installing a Database

The following steps can be adapted to install a database into the currently running farmOS instance:

```
docker stop fd2_postgres
sudo chmod g+rwx $HOME/FarmData2/docker/db
cd $HOME/FarmData2/docker/db
sudo rm -rf ./*
sudo tar -xzf $HOME/FD2-SampleDBs/dist/db.base.tar.gz
docker start fd2_postgres
```

Change the `db.X.tar.gz` filename in the `sudo tar` command to match the desired database.

## Development

To change, modify, update, add a database:

- Prerequisites:
  - Fork the `FD2-SampleDBs` upstream repository
  - Clone your fork into the FarmData2 Development Environment
1. Ensure that your `development` branch is synchronized with the `upstream`
2. Create a new feature branch from the `development` branch
3. Make and test changes in your feature branch
4. Run the `bin/buildDBs.bash` script
5. Install and test that the new database works 
   - See [Manually Installing a Database](#manually-installing-a-database) above
6. Commit to your feature branch:
   - The changes you have made to the code.
   - The newly created database files (e.g. `db.base.tar.gz`)
7. Pull and merge any new changes to the `development` branch into your feature branch
8. Create a pull request to the `development` branch in the upstream

A maintainer will:

1. Review your pull request and provide feedback
2. If/when appropriate squash merge your pull request into the `development` branch
   - The squash merge commit message must be a conventional commit message.
     - This will create a pre-release `vX.Y.Z-development.n`
       - X.Y.Z is the semantic version of the next release if created at the moment
       - n is a sequence number for pre-releases with the same semantic version number.

## Creating a Release

When changes warranting a new release have been added to the `development` branch a maintainer will create a new release by:

1. Fast-forward merging the latest `development` branch into the `production` branch
2. Pushing the `production` branch to the upstream
   - This will create a new release `vX.Y.Z`
     - X.Y.Z is the semantic version of the release
     - All but the most recent `development` pre-release will be deleted
     - The CHANGELOG.md file in the `production` branch is updated with the changes added
     - The `production` branch is _backmerged_ into the `development` branch
